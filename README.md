# daikon-code-contract-extensions

This project is a library of extension/utility methods for concisely representing [Daikon](http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/) invariants as [Code Contracts](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/contracts/).

To generate traces of .NET programs for use with Daikon, use the [Celeriac](https://github.com/melonhead901/daikon-dot-net-front-end) front-end.
